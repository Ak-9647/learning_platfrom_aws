# Description: Create React components for setting learning goals with AI suggestions and marking checkpoints.
# Details:
Implement React components for goal setting with AI-generated suggestions and checkpoint marking. The UI should allow users to define learning goals, receive AI-generated suggestions, and mark checkpoints throughout the document. Persist goals and checkpoints to the backend and generate StructuredContent with embeddings for AI processing. Implement autosave functionality for goals and checkpoints.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for React components using Jest and React Testing Library. Test goal setting, AI suggestions, checkpoint marking, and persistence. Test the generation of StructuredContent and embeddings. Verify autosave functionality and error handling.
