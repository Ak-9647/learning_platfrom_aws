# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Data Migration Scripts
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Create scripts for migrating from mock data to real data with feature flag control.
# Details:
Implement data migration scripts that can move from mock data to real data. The scripts should be reversible to support rollback if needed. Implement feature flags to control the cutover from mock to real data. Include validation steps to ensure data integrity during migration. Design the migration to be non-disruptive to active users.

# Test Strategy:
Test migration scripts in staging environment with production-like data volumes. Verify data integrity before and after migration. Test rollback procedures. Measure migration performance and optimize for minimal downtime. Test feature flag behavior for controlling the cutover.
