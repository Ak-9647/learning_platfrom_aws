# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize application performance through caching, provisioned concurrency, and efficient resource usage.
# Details:
Implement performance optimizations: 1) Configure provisioned concurrency for Lambda functions to reduce cold starts, 2) Implement caching using DAX for DynamoDB and ElastiCache for frequent queries, 3) Optimize database access patterns and queries, 4) Implement efficient resource loading and lazy loading in the UI. Monitor and tune performance to meet targets (Agent p50 ≤2s, parsing ≤60s typical).

# Test Strategy:
Conduct performance testing: 1) Load testing with realistic usage patterns, 2) Measure and verify response times against targets, 3) Test cache hit rates and effectiveness, 4) Verify provisioned concurrency behavior under load. Document performance metrics and optimizations.
