# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Analytics Event Collection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an event collection system that captures user interactions and writes them to Kinesis.
# Details:
Implement an event writer that captures user interactions and analytics events. Send events to Kinesis, which forwards to Firehose for storage in S3 as Parquet files. Define a comprehensive event schema that captures all required analytics data. Implement client-side and server-side event collection. Ensure events include necessary context and correlation IDs.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for event collection, serialization, and transmission. Test integration with Kinesis and Firehose. Verify correct Parquet file generation in S3. Test with high event volumes to ensure performance and reliability. Verify event schema correctness and backward compatibility.
