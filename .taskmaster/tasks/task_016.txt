# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Observability Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive observability solution with structured logging, metrics, and alerts.
# Details:
Implement an observability framework: 1) Structured logging with correlation IDs across all services, 2) CloudWatch metrics for key operations (DocumentProcessing, API, Auth, Agent, Websocket), 3) SNS alerts for critical errors and performance issues, 4) Typed error handling that maps to user-friendly responses. Ensure logs don't contain PII or sensitive information.

# Test Strategy:
Test the observability framework: 1) Verify log format and correlation ID propagation, 2) Test metric collection and dashboard visualization, 3) Simulate error conditions to verify alerts, 4) Verify PII exclusion from logs. Test the complete observability pipeline from error to alert.
