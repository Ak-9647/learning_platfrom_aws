# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Document Editor UI - Core Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create React components for the document editor's core functionality including slide preview and navigation.
# Details:
Implement React components for the document editor with slide preview and navigation capabilities. The UI should support viewing and navigating through parsed document content. Implement autosave functionality with WebSocket sync for real-time collaboration. Ensure the UI meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. Use React hooks for state management and consider using a UI component library that supports accessibility.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for React components using Jest and React Testing Library. Test navigation, preview rendering, and autosave functionality. Perform accessibility testing using automated tools (e.g., axe-core) and manual testing with screen readers. Test WebSocket sync with multiple concurrent users.
