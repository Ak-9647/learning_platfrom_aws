# Design Document – Cursor Integration for Interactive Learning Platform

## Purpose
Define the design approach for integrating **Cursor** into the development workflow for the Interactive Learning Platform.

## Integration Approach
1. **AI Planning Phase** – Developers request a 'plan' from Cursor before any code changes.
2. **Diff Proposal Phase** – Cursor generates file-by-file diffs using our standard format.
3. **Review Phase** – Developers review proposed diffs, run tests, and request modifications.
4. **Merge Phase** – Approved diffs are merged via PR with CI/CD checks.

## Key Components
- **Cursor.md**: Defines rules, constraints, and working agreements.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Enforces linting, testing, and coverage thresholds on Cursor-generated PRs.
- **Configuration Manager**: Ensures environment variables are validated before applying code changes.

## Data Flow
Developer → Cursor (plan + diff) → Review → CI/CD pipeline → Deployment

## Security Considerations
- Cursor must never commit secrets.
- All environment variables pulled from AWS SSM or Secrets Manager.
- PRs flagged for touching sensitive modules (auth, payments) require manual review.

## Testing Strategy
- Cursor output must include unit and integration tests.
- Test failures block merges automatically.
- Performance regression tests run on every PR.

## Rollback Strategy
- Feature flags wrap major changes.
- Blue-green deployment with instant rollback.
