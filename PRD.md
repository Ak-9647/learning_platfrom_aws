# Product Requirements Document (PRD) – Cursor Integration for Interactive Learning Platform

## Overview
This PRD defines how the Interactive Learning Platform will integrate with **Cursor** to enable AI-assisted development workflows. Cursor will serve as an embedded AI assistant for repository code generation, code review, and architectural guidance, following our strict security, compliance, and performance standards.

## Goals
1. Accelerate feature development by using Cursor for planning, coding, and testing.
2. Ensure AI-generated changes align with our **productionalization roadmap**.
3. Maintain high-quality, secure, and compliant codebase.

## User Stories
### As a Developer
I want Cursor to propose code changes with clear plans, file lists, and diffs so that I can confidently apply updates.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Plans include high-level approach, file tree of changes, and open questions.
- Diffs are limited to ≤300 net lines unless explicitly approved.
- Cursor output includes unit/integration test coverage.

### As a Tech Lead
I want to ensure Cursor respects architecture boundaries, environment configurations, and compliance requirements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Cursor never hardcodes secrets or defaults.
- Cursor validates changes against stable API and data contracts.
- Cursor flags any change impacting security, compliance, or performance.

### As a QA Engineer
I want Cursor to produce testable changes with automated test cases.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Cursor PRs include runnable unit tests.
- Cursor updates test data where necessary.
- Test coverage is ≥80% on modified files.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: Must comply with TLS 1.2+, KMS encryption, PII redaction, and least-privilege IAM.
- **Performance**: Changes must not degrade agent p50 latency beyond 2 seconds.
- **Compliance**: GDPR/CCPA handling must remain intact.
- **Accessibility**: UI updates meet WCAG 2.1 AA.

## Out of Scope
- Changing the core business logic of the Interactive Learning Platform without human review.
- Any architectural change without Tech Lead sign-off.
